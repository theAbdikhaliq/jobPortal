# JobPortal 

Welcome to JobPortal, a MERN-based User Management App! This application has been developed to showcase my skills in building a full-stack web application using the MERN stack. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my professionalism and expertise in developing with MERN  and utilizing various technologies.

JobPortal consists of two main parts the jobs section and the blog section, where logged in users can post and comment other posts.

## Techonologies
* React
* Tailwind CSS
* Express
* MongoDB
* JWT

## Features

- **User Management:** The app allows users to register, login, and manage their profiles. During registration and login, the email and password provided by the user are authorized against the existing records. If the credentials do not match, a toast notification using Toastify is displayed at the bottom of the page.

- **Post Management:** Users can create and delete their own job postings/blogs. The application follows the **MVC** (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern to organize and manage the codebase effectively.

- **Commenting System:** Users can comment on job postings. Only the comment owner has the authority to delete their own comments.

- **JWT Authorization:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for user authentication and authorization.

- **Axios Integration:** Axios, a popular HTTP client library, is utilized to fetch data from the API built within this application.
